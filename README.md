# jPasi
Originally a Java applet for creating diagrams that exports LaTeX code. The original functionality is still there, and it does run in an IDE. Only the embedding applet is missing, having been deleted long ago (since applets are now deprecated). I'm currently trying to reimplement this diagram editor in Typescript, in the form of a web application built on Next.js. You can find this ongoing project [here](https://github.com/jplate/pasi).
